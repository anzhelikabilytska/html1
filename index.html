<h2><center>Explore the Royal Parks</center></h2>

<div>
<ul>
<li><h3>Hyde Park</h3><h4>This vast open space in the heart of the city is packed with things to discover. At its heart is the Serpentine, boasting panoramic lake-side paths, waterfront cafes, the official Royal Parks shop, and an abundance of wildlife to spot. Look out for the heron under the bridge – and hardy swimmers at the Lido, home to the oldest swimming club in Britain.</h4></li>

<li><h3>Richmond Park</h3><h4>Its ancient woods, rolling hills and wide-open grasslands are bursting with life – from historic herds of deer to birds, invertebrates, fungi and wildflowers.</h4></li>

<li><h3>Kensington Gardens</h3><h4>Dreamed up by Queen Caroline in the 18th century, these celebrated gardens were originally part of Kensington Palace. Today, they are open to everyone – no longer exclusive, but still extraordinary. 
</h4></li>

<li><h3>St. James's Park</h3><h4>This is the most royal of London’s Royal Parks. Shaped by generations of monarchs and bordered by three royal palaces, St. James’s Park is the home of ceremonial events in the capital. From royal weddings and jubilees to military parades and state celebrations – this is the park where history is made. </h4></li>
